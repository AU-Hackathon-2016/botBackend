I have served as a full time apartment groundsman since before 2007. Before then, I was a full time janitor at a local sheriff's department through county employment. And before that, I worked part time fast food jobs as a teenager/young adult. But more recently, I've loved being an apartment groundsman the most. The previous property management companies and apartment communities that I served at had either gone out of business, closed down or were bought out. However, during my tenure, I'd always wanted to learn the trade of apartment maintenance, and learn something new, to possibly make a career out of it. Yet I was never afforded the opportunity. I was always limited to grounds work, and basically an errands guy and sort of an assistant to the maintenance staff whenever I wasn't tending the grounds. I did however get an opportunity to learn and do the following:\n\nUnclog bathroom and kitchen sinks and bathtubs with needle-nosed pliers\nReplace commercial lights\nreplace fire extinguishers\nreplace toilet seats in apartment bathrooms\nCleaned leaves and debris from swimming pool\nInstall appliances for new move-ins\nWork trash compactor...and some other general entry level maintenance work.\n\nBut I want to move on and learn even more, such as full swimming pool care, possibly obtain CPO,   caulking, punch units, and other major maintenance duties. I'm already aware that apartment maintenance is a field where you can always learn. You never stop learning in it, and that's what I want!\n\nIf you are in need of a hard working and loyal groundskeeper, who has definite long-term goals, and if your maintenance team would be willing to do some OTJ training, then I am most certainly the one who will do that for you. Please, if you would be interested in speaking with me, call me at the number listed below, and I will be more than glad that you did.\n\nAL KING @ 470-878-5116"}, {"text": "Hi,\n\nIs your house full of unnecessary items that aren't being used?
